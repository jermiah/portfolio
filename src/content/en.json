      "Develop a compact router using deterministic rules and a fallback small model for ambiguous cases.",
      "Normalize entity extraction (dates, quantities, contacts) via hybrid rule–LLM methods.",
      "Integrate a mini RAG layer for PDF and spreadsheet data to handle product and service information retrieval.",
      "Evaluate the agent for routing accuracy, end-to-end success, latency, cost, and safety metrics."
